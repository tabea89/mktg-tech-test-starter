    "content": "<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>With over 100 million customers, T-Mobile is the #2 wireless carrier in the US. The company has been recognized year after year for commitment to outstanding customer service, recently named to Newsweek&#39;s Best Customer Service Companies 2020 and awarded #1 for U.S. Wireless Full-Service Customer Care by J.D. Power.</p>\n\n<p>Providing consistently excellent customer service relies on more than experienced agents. It also requires technology that empowers human agents to be their most effective. One of the most striking customer service technology trends in recent years has been the widespread adoption of virtual assistants, particularly among millennials, who value the convenience and ability to receive an immediate response. Across industries, virtual assistants allow customers to contact companies on their terms and timeline, freeing human agents to focus on solving customers&#39; most challenging problems.</p>\n\n<p>The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic acutely highlighted the need for this type of self-serve option for T-Mobile Messaging customers. At times, over 20k+ customers could be in queue to speak with a T-Mobile Expert, many with simple requests. Creating an automated, self-service alternative promised to dramatically decrease wait times and time to resolution, improving customer experience while relieving pressure on human agents. With routine requests handled by an assistant, T-Mobile Experts could focus on problems requiring empathy and complex problem-solving.</p>\n\n<p>Lindsey McCarthy, Senior Technical Product Manager on the AI @ T-Mobile team, summarized: &quot;We wanted to create value for our customers by giving them the option to complete simple tasks online or offer them information for simple questions.&quot; Lindsey noted that the assistant also needed to properly direct the customer when the reason for contact fell outside of the assistant&#39;s current capabilities. &quot;It&#39;s extremely important that they can get to an Expert quickly if the virtual assistant cannot solve their problem.&quot;</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>The AI @ T-Mobile team was tasked with building a new virtual assistant to assist Messaging customers. Previous experience taking a sales virtual assistant to market in 2019 left the team with learnings that would shape their approach. That assistant, built by an outside vendor, had proven to be expensive and difficult to manage. T-Mobile decided to bring the development of their virtual assistant fully in-house using Rasa, allowing T-Mobile to own and customize every aspect of their virtual assistant.</p>\n\n<p>After selecting Rasa as the conversational AI framework for their virtual assistant, T-Mobile launched an MVP version in July 2020. The virtual assistant is able to customize experiences for users that qualify for self-service. Customers are automatically qualified by starting a messaging conversation with an intent that matches a topic the virtual assistant can handle. From there, the virtual assistant acts as a wayfinder, pointing the customer in the right direction. Some transactions can be fully resolved by the assistant, without transferring the customer to another channel.</p>\n\n<p>Working alongside the Rasa Customer Success team, T-Mobile&#39;s full-stack team built an API integration to customize the user experience, integrated with T-Mobile&#39;s chat platform, and rapidly assessed language changes and model updates. Taking an iterative and agile approach, T-Mobile continually releases improvements to the assistant, sometimes shipping updates 2-3 times per week.</p>\n\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n\n<p>Since launch, T-Mobile&#39;s virtual assistant has reached 10% of Messaging customers, with a goal of serving 25% of customers with seamless, personalized conversational experiences by the end of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The AI @ T-Mobile team continues to expand the capabilities and scope of their virtual assistant, looking ahead to launching new self-service options and expanding to Apple Business chat for iOS users in 2021 and beyond.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"lindsey-mccarthy\"/></p>\n",

    "content": "<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nib.com.au/\">nib Group</a> (nib) provides health and medical insurance to over 1.4 million Australian and New Zealand residents, and the company is also Australia&#39;s third largest travel insurer.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, nib became the first private insurer in Australia and New Zealand to improve member experience by leveraging AI with the introduction of nibby. nibby is a digital assistant embedded in the nib online member portal and mobile app, and available after hours via voice. nibby relieves pressure on human agents by providing a first line of support, including call routing and providing answers to common questions.</p>\n\n<p><Button to=\"https://www.nib.com.au/nibby/\">\n  Chat with nibby →\n</Button></p>\n\n<p>One of nibby&#39;s primary duties is ensuring members are routed to the appropriate team. This automated routing results in decreased handle times while eliminating the frustration of being transferred from call center to call center. nibby identifies members as international visitors, students, Australian residents, or healthcare providers during the first interaction, and nibby also sorts inquiries to sales or support.</p>\n\n<p>Since launch, nib has continued to review and redesign nibby, with the goals of improved member experience, increased efficiency, and higher productivity. With a long-term vision of an assistant that went beyond FAQs, nib worked to make nibby more contextual and sophisticated.</p>\n\n<p>The first iteration of nibby was built on an enterprise cloud-based NLU. Over time, the nib team identified opportunities to advance nibby, but doing so would require greater customization capabilities and ownership over their machine learning models. While the cloud-based NLU offered a set of capabilities out of the box, a feature request was the only path to getting more out of the platform. In addition, the team saw a chance to make the update process more predictable and reliable. Having greater visibility into updates that flowed into the NLU framework would allow the team to avoid unexpected interactions with their own code updates.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>With a team of data scientists and engineers ready to bring nibby to its full potential, nib began to benchmark alternative conversational AI frameworks. Rasa stood out for its extensibility and flexibility, as well as for features like the ability to customize channel-specific responses. Rasa&#39;s enterprise open source framework provided the freedom to build custom features on nib&#39;s timeline, rather than relying on a vendor&#39;s roadmap, and developers and data scientists had complete visibility into updates and functionality flowing into the product.</p>\n\n<p>nib also embraced the Rasa approach to stories and dialogue management, which offered two benefits. First, Rasa reduced complexity. According to Dom Sammut, Engineering Manager - Conversational Experiences at nib, &quot;Before, we had massive diagrams, like big trees,&quot; which mapped out hypothetical member journeys. After migrating to Rasa, the team shifted their approach, moving to small conversation blocks that could be interconnected. This more nimble approach allowed the team to design flexible conversation flows that responded to the member, rather than enforcing a narrow, prescribed path for users to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Rasa offered a development flow that allowed developers and conversation designers to work together harmoniously. Conversation designers were able to write stories and create dialogues independently, without requiring developer resources. For functionality that did require custom Python functions, conversation designers could simply reference the action name in the dialogue, a process the team found to be much more cumbersome with the original cloud-based NLU. &quot;With Rasa, it was super straightforward,&quot; Dom said. &quot;I can give our conversation designer a list of the custom action names and they can drop them into the story.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the decision to replatform came down to long-term vision and building the best possible assistant. &quot;We wanted to have a bot that could have the best conversation and most natural and helpful conversations with members, and that was Rasa at the end of the day.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In the process of migrating to Rasa, nib seized the opportunity to refresh the underlying design of nibby, removing legacy code and rethinking the way conversations were handled from scratch. Working alongside the Rasa Customer Success Engineering team, nib completed the migration within three months. Post-migration, the Rasa team has continued to work closely with nib, partnering to identify and solve issues, and taking a hands-on approach to version upgrades and feature development.</p>\n\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n\n<p>nibby&#39;s success has allowed agents to focus on impactful conversations, grown the team and business around conversational AI, and expanded nib&#39;s AI assistant program to more channels. As more and more companies seek to create the same customer experience across multiple channels at scale, serving many channels with a single Rasa assistant has allowed nib to leverage their existing assistant to serve more members.</p>\n\n<p>In the three years nibby has been online, member interactions have increased by over 900%, with a conversation understanding rate of 95%. Over 50% of conversations are resolved by pointing the member to content or a self-service resource.</p>\n\n<p>Since laying a new technical foundation with Rasa and incorporating consistent listening and learning from members, nibby has reached new milestones in 2020:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Served over 150,000 members, a 200% increase from 2019</li>\n<li>Introduced product information in four languages, for international students and workers</li>\n<li>Delivered COVID-19 information to members</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>nib continues to improve nibby, with a target of increasing deflection rate and member satisfaction in years ahead.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"dom-sammut\" /></p>\n",

But with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the challenges of scale took on a new urgency.</p>\n\n<p>The Brazilian government selected PicPay as the payment app through which all emergency aid funds would be paid out to families across Brazil. Through the PicPay app, users would be able to validate whether they qualified for aid with the Brazilian government and claim their benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The logistical challenges of the plan were considerable: a spike in customer service contacts, a user base with limited digital literacy, and above all, a mandate to roll out a solution in weeks, not months.</p>\n\n<p>To manage the expected volume and ensure all users were able to access their benefits regardless of tech savviness, PicPay designed a conversational interface: an AI assistant that led users through the entire process.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>With time of the essence, PicPay chose Rasa to provide the framework for conversational AI. The team’s past experience with Rasa made it a top contender during the evaluation process, and ultimately Rasa was selected over IBM Watson on the basis of both cost and accuracy. Another deciding factor was Rasa’s open source approach and the visibility it offered into constant improvements within the product, as well as the ability to support language localization in Portuguese.</p>\n\n<p>PicPay’s team of developers, content editors, and data scientists worked closely with the Rasa Customer Success Engineering team to meet an ambitious launch deadline of just two weeks. 10 business days later, on May 13, the PicPay assistant was live in production.</p>\n\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n\n<p>In just the first hour, PicPay’s assistant handled 3,000 transactions, averaging 100,000 users per day during the first week. Traffic has remained high ever since, with the assistant handling between 20k and 65k interactions per day.</p>\n\n<p>With a combination of technology and nimble development, PicPay was able to mobilize the distribution of aid across Brazil. The success of PicPay’s Rasa assistant has led the team to look toward future improvements, including integration with Zendesk and WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"isaac-ben-akiva\" /></p>\n",

Given the continuous flow of patient requests, Circle Medical was searching for a scalable solution that provides a personalized experience and meets the high standards of their patients.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>Using Rasa’s advanced machine learning-based dialogue management, Circle Medical was able to automate a use case for medication prescription refills within a few weeks. The customizability of Rasa Core enabled the team to provide a personalized solution that integrates into their own system and can handle multiple turns in the course of one conversation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the team was able to host everything on their HIPAA-compliant hosting infrastructure, encrypting conversations in transit and storage to ensure full patient privacy.</p>\n\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n\n<p>Automating prescription refills demonstrated massive potential to increase patient satisfaction through faster response cycles, while saving costs. More than 50 percent of refill requests are fully handled by the AI assistant, requiring physicians only for review and approval. Physicians feedback was overwhelmingly positive, as automating repetitive tasks enabled them to focus on important in-depth discussions with a greater number of patients.</p>\n\n<p>Circle Medical is now working on expanding their AI assistant to include additional use cases.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"circle-medical-jsb\" /></p>\n",

    "content": "<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dialogue.co\">Dialogue</a>’s mission is to improve humanity’s well-being by reducing barriers to quality care. As Canada’s leading virtual health care platform, Dialogue offers integrated healthcare services for employers to keep their employees happy, healthy, and performing at their highest potential. A full range of health professionals, from nurses to physicians and allied health practitioners, are available at the click of a button via mobile phone or computer to help employees optimize their work-life balance.</p>\n\n<p>Dialogue has enjoyed rapid adoption in recent years, but with success comes the challenge of delivering great care at scale.</p>\n\n<p>To address this challenge, Dialogue set out to automate the patient intake process by developing a conversational AI assistant capable of gathering information about patients’ medical conditions through a conversational evaluation before introducing them to a member of the care team.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>During the patient intake evaluation, Dialogue’s contextual assistant uses Rasa NLU to classify patients’ chief complaint and uses Rasa Core for generating conversational responses. The assistant supports three different languages—English, French, and German—depending on user preference and can support multiple users in a single conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to integrate with existing systems and modify conversational AI components was a key requirement of the project. The Rasa action server integrates external services that support the patient experience, like a patient profile service. Dialogue also extended the Rasa Form Policy to integrate an external inference engine for managing the patient evaluation dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>Multimedia and innovative message types provide a richer patient experience within the Dialogue Virtual Clinic. Moving beyond simple text questions with suggested replies, patients can upload files and images through the interface, and the Dialogue Virtual Clinic even allows patients to select a specific part of the body where they experience pain from a visual representation.</p>\n\n<p>Dialogue’s tech stack includes Mattermost for messaging and relies on Docker images containing Rasa components—Core, NLU, and action server—that are deployed using Kubernetes on AWS EKS, through a CircleCI deployment pipeline. Dialogue Virtual Clinic includes a variety of client-side applications that interface with the conversational agent, including, implementations written using React, React Native, Android Native, and Electron.</p>\n\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n\n<p>Dialogue leverages technology to help the care team deliver the safest and highest quality care to patients. The Virtual Clinic assistant automates, standardizes, and removes human bias from key steps in the patient experience so the care team can focus on what matters most: patients and their safety.</p>\n\n<p>Patients can now complete an evaluation anytime, anywhere, in only a few minutes on average—compared to the time-consuming process patients are used to with the traditional medical system. This process helps the care team consult patients efficiently, so they can continue to provide quality care to a greater number of patients in a smarter, more effective way.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"alexis-smirnov\" /></p>\n",

With this in mind, Helvetia sought to automate conversations and engage users proactively, without sacrificing quality. The Swiss insurance industry sets the benchmark for data privacy, another absolute requirement.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>Helvetia decided to build a powerful AI assistant that could offer insurance policies to customers via text message, with Rasa providing the underlying NLU and dialogue management.

    "content": "<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eddytravels.com\">Eddy Travels</a> is a travel tech startup based in Toronto, Canada. Founded in August 2018, the startup developed an AI-powered assistant that provides personalized travel suggestions. Travelers can send a text or voice message to Eddy Travels and discover the best flights, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services in one place. The digital assistant is already available on the most popular messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Viber, Slack, and Line.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, the team used Dialogflow for natural language understanding. However, the dialogue could not deviate from pre-defined flows and Eddy Travels had no control over the source code. It was hard for the team to maintain the platform, and difficult to collaborate. There was no easy way to set up the required test suite to evaluate the performance of the digital assistant.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>As an open source platform, Rasa is much more customizable - it allows Eddy Travels to change any piece of code to suit their specific needs. For example, by customizing the machine learning models, they improved the assistant’s ability to handle more complex language structures and achieved better results, reaching high accuracy as a result. They also have full control of their data and do not have to share it with any third parties.</p>\n\n<p>Eddy Travels’ focus remains on improving the assistant’s language understanding, adding more high-quality travel products and services, and expanding the level of personalization. The Canadian-based startup is planning to launch Eddy Travels on WeChat and WhatsApp messaging applications and develop their own mobile app later this year.</p>\n\n<p><Quote dataKey=\"edmundas-balcikonis\" /></p>\n",

    "content": "<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>A large European travel website has hundreds of customer booking requests daily. The majority are urgent, with customers about to start their journey or already in a foreign country. The increased cost pressure in the industry is forcing companies to invest into automation.</p>\n\n<p>Conversations about bookings tend to get complex very quickly. There are a lot of specific rules and not many standards, meaning simple FAQ-based bots typically add little value for customers. Deep integrations into backend systems are required, as well as a way to train specific machine learning models for the travel industry vocabulary.</p>\n\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n<p>Using Rasa, the company built a conversational travel agent which could handle complex interactions with customers. The agent is end-to-end automated with machine learning-based dialogue management and deep backend integrations. The company was also able to improve the accuracy of their language model by integrating real conversations.</p>\n\n<p>The company went from idea to deployment in less than three months. Focusing on a few use cases with high volume of customer service on Facebook Messenger, after a short training phase the AI assistant was able to handle more than 25% of requests. Now, the company plans to expand into further use cases and conversational platforms like WhatsApp and live web chat.</p>\n",

Tailored to their enterprise IT landscape and deployed on-prem, the in-house product team completed a Proof of Concept within two months.</p>\n\n<p>With proof of concept successful, the management was convinced to further invest.
